PushPitch2Mod - Modwheel for Ableton Push
=============

PushPitch2Mod is a Max for Live device that permits you to use Ableton Push's pitchbend touch strip as a modwheel. The device works on a per-track basis, meaning that you can have the touch strip act as a modwheel on one track, while retaining pitch bend functionality on another.
